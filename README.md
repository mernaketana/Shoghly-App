# Sho3'ly-app

### The mobile application version of the website sho3'ly built as a graduation project by me and my team members. 

## Detailed Description

### The application is meant to create a unified platform for different kinds of skilled trades, such as carpentry, plumbing, welding, etc. 
### Tradesmen are able to create an account detailing information about them that can facilitate the process of reaching them, as well as, adding pictures and discriptions of their work. 
### Different users are able to create accounts to check tradesmen and find contact information about them, as well as, create reviews of different tradesmen and check formerly posted reviews by other users.
